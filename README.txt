This is a simple password manager.
The main function of this program is to allow the user to input the account in which the password will be used for, and then the actual password.
I've also added the ability to generate a random string of characters as a password along with the ability to import it into the main function.
It's not meant to be overly complicated just a more efficient way to generate and organize passwords.
